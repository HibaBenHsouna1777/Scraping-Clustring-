Scraping and Clustering AlarabiaTN News
This project demonstrates how to scrape news articles from the AlarabiaTN website and use clustering techniques to group similar articles together.

Goal: The primary goal is to identify trends and patterns in the news data by analyzing clusters of similar articles.

Approach:

Web Scraping: Utilize Python and the Beautiful Soup library to extract news articles from the AlarabiaTN website.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the scraped data for analysis, including text cleaning and feature extraction.
Clustering: Employ clustering algorithms from scikit-learn (e.g., K-Means) to group similar articles into clusters.
Visualization: Visualize the clusters using matplotlib and seaborn to explore trends and patterns.
Libraries Used:

Beautiful Soup
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Pandas
